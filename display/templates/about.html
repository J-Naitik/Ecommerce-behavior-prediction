    <div class="about-content">
        <div class="about-card">
            <h2>Item-Based Collaborative Filtering</h2>
            <p>Our recommendation engine uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze your purchase history and find products similar to ones you've already bought.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-card">
            <h2>Similarity Scoring</h2>
            <p>We calculate similarity scores between products using cosine similarity on a user-item purchase matrix. Products with higher similarity scores are more likely to match your preferences.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-card">
            <h2>Personalized Recommendations</h2>
            <p>Each recommendation is tailored to your unique purchase history. We weight recent and frequently purchased items more heavily to ensure relevant suggestions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="about-card">
            <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
            <p>Our system learns from patterns in millions of transactions to continuously improve recommendation accuracy and help you discover products you'll love.</p>
